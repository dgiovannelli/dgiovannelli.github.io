From September 7-14, 2019 our team headed out to the Aeolian Archipelago for a sampling expedition. The island are volcanoes formed by the subduction of the Ionian plate under the Calabria peninsula, and are extremely active with numerous on land and underwater secondary geothermal manifestations. In just under a week the team sampled 8 new sites in four different islands (Salina, Vulcano, Lipari and Panarea), both on land and underwater. In every island we tried to follow a land-to-sea transect, crossing geothermal features likely feed by similar volatile reservoir but sustaining very different microbial communities.

The sampling expedition, in collaboration with Giulia Bernardi of the [Blue Marine Foundation](http://) and the Aeolian Island Preservation Funds aimed at mapping the diversity of microbial communities present in the different geothermal environments, and included few days of exploration of new sites. Joined the team also Prof. Costa Vetriani from Rutgers University [(visit his website here)](http://deepseamicrobiologylab.). This was also the first extreme environment sampling expedition for our lab member Michele Intoccia, Martina Cascone, Rosaria Capuozzo and Alessandra Ferrillo.

The samples, part of a growing set of samples collected globally in volcanic areas and shallow-water hydrothermal vents (see our recent publications *[Barry et al., 2019 Nature](http://)* and *[Giovannelli and Price, 2018 Encyclopedia of Ocean Sciences](http://)*, will be analyzed by Alessandra Ferrillo as part of her Master thesis. Additional samples have been also collected for our partner laboratories, including Mustafa Yucel (METU, Turkey), Shaunna Morrison (CWI, USA) and Mayuko Nakagawa (ELSI, Japan).
