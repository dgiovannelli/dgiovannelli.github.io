The MM&H program is inviting proposals for the Moon Shot Project. The detailed description of request for application can be found in the RFA below. Deadline for submission is Friday 3rd November 2023 at 11.59 am UTC. Proposal have to be submitted exclusively through the provided online submission system.

# Request for Applications (RFA)
## Lunar Human Colony Microbial-Enabled Support System Program

### Art. 1 - General
The MM&H program is designed to provide innovative solutions for the support of a long term human colony on the Moon. MM&H is requesting proposal for microbial-enabled support systems for the Moon Shot Project. The primary objective of this RFA is to encourage the development of cutting-edge microbial-based technologies that support human life on the Moon. These systems should address key aspects such as life support, resource utilization, and waste management, while ensuring the safety and sustainability of lunar habitats.

### Art. 2 - Available Resources
The total budget assigned to the project is 600 Million Euro, and will be assigned to a single proposal selected by the MM&H review panel. Once assigned, the winning team will have 40 days to develop the project and present a full plan to the review board.

### Art. 3 - Proponents
Proposals can be presented by any of the class participant organized in team. Each team will need to be of minimum 2 and maximum 3 participants.

### Art. 4 - Proposal format
The proposal can be a maximum of 5 pages (Arial, pt. 11, single space, 2 cm margin on all side), including references, figures and tables, and will need to contain, at minimum, the following:

 1. State of the Art. Proposals should provide a comprehensive review of the current state of microbial research in space environments. This includes microbial metabolism, habitability factors on the Moon, and relevant findings from previous space missions or Earth-based analogs. Special emphasis should be placed on recent advancements in microbial-enabled technologies.

 2. Support System Design. Applicants must outline the design and functionalities of the microbial-enabled support systems. This includes, but is not limited to, details on life support systems, waste recycling, food production, and health management. The integration of microbial solutions into these systems should be clearly articulated.

 3. Management Plan. Proposals should include a detailed management plan that outlines the roles and responsibilities of the project team, a timeline for project execution, and a risk management strategy. This section should demonstrate the feasibility of completing the project within the allocated 40-day timeline.

 4. Budget Plan. Applicants are expected to provide a comprehensive budget plan that allocates the 600 million Euro funding across all project components. Detailed cost estimates for research, development, testing, and implementation are essential. Any anticipated partnerships or collaborations should also be disclosed.

### Art. 5 - Microbial-Enabled Support System
One of the key requirements of this RFA is the development of a microbial-enabled support system. Microbes can play a critical role in lunar habitat sustainability by contributing to waste recycling, oxygen production, food production, and water purification. Proposals should clearly demonstrate how microbial solutions will be integrated into the broader support system to ensure human survival on the Moon. Besides being constrained by the available money, the total amount of payload possible is limited to 800 kg.

### Art. 6 - Project submission
Deadline for submission is Friday 3rd November 2023 at 11.59 am UTC. Proposal have to be submitted exclusively through the provided online submission system [https://forms.gle/QqQZK3uY9eqiVf1bA](https://forms.gle/QqQZK3uY9eqiVf1bA). A single PDF should be uploaded, consisting of the proposal, the budget table (single page) and the [Cover sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OT9Ae_VluF1IEYx3gc76bAZQyZixiIOZ-8ckxyDN5E/edit?usp=sharing). Template for the cover sheet can be found here. The proposal cover page will need to clearly indicate the project team and have their hand signatures present. Only proposal completed in all their part will be evaluated.

### Art. 7 - Evaluation Criteria
Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
 1. Scientific and technical merit (max 10 point)
 2. Innovation and novelty of microbial-enabled solutions (max 30 point)
 3. Feasibility and adherence to the 40-day timeline (max 30 point)
 4. Cost-effectiveness and efficient resource utilization (max 20 point)
 5. Safety and environmental considerations (max 10 point)

All submissions will undergo a rigorous review process by a panel of experts form the MM&H class. Only one proposal will be awarded.
