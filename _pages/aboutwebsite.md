# Use this website as a template for your academic research group

This website was forked from <a href="https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab">The Allan Lab</a> GitHub website. You can copy and  modify it for your own research group. I customized few features and for sure I committed a lot of mistakes, so you better start off directly from the <a href="https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab">Allan Lab version</a> or go check out the <a href="">minimal-mistake template</a> the website is based on. It is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and uses some [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) and  [Bootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com). Allan tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to re-use it for your purpose.

### Copyright / credit

As stated by the Allan Lab, you can use this template as you please. You don't have to link to us or the Allan lab (but of course its appreciated). We also welcome it if you send an email with a link to your website, perhaps we'll publish a list here at some point.

Comments welcome.
