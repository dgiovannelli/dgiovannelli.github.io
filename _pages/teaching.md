# Teaching

I feel extremely privileged in being able to teach specialized courses to the graduate students in Biology at the University of Naples. Here you'll find information about the current and past courses, including elective classes I've designed over the year. For every course I'm working to upload all the pdf and course material for future reference.

A great idea would be to have a centralized repository were professor can exchange course material freely, like a GitHub of teaching Or perhaps GitHub is the way to go? If you know something in this regards or have ideas you would like to discuss drop me a [line on twitter](https://twitter.com/d_giovannelli).

While teaching I generally like to keep my classes informal and have plenty of discussion (class size permitting). I usually assign several option readings for students interested in going deeper, and usually we spend sometime each class discussing the papers. I've been recently introducing the construction of Winogradsky columns as a way to do both class activities and outreach. Here a picture of some of our columns.

In my smaller classes (below 40 students) I request that the student contribute toward Wikipedia by selecting a stub-class or start-class article and improve it. This is usually accomplished in teams of 3-5 people, and we had great success over the last couple of years, contributing to topics in Marine Microbial Diversity. Here you can see an example of the stats relative to 2020 Marine Microbial Diversity class contribution to Wikipedia. For a complete list of the articles contributed by year [see below](#Wikipedia-contributions).
