#Vacancies and Current Openings

We are constantly looking for talented and passionate people to join our team, so even if you don't see specific positions here, don't be afraid to drop us an email! We can always discuss the possibility of writing a fellowship together to get to join us!

Visiting positions are always possible, especially if funded though one of the many program that can support your visit here, like the [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) and the Erasmus+ program (https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/).

Below you'll find information about current searches at the [PhD](#phd-positions), [Postdoctoral level](#postdoctoral-fellow-positions) or with any time of qualification!

##PhD Positions
**MSCA PhD position in the Microbiology of Shallow-Water Hydrothermal Vents**. A PhD position is open in my lab funded through the MSCA Doctoral Program CRESCENDO [www.crescendo.unina.it/](https://www.crescendo.unina.it/) to work on the microbiology of Shallow-Water Hydrothermal Vents. Deadline to apply is on June 30th, 2022. Al the relevant information regarding salary and the application process are on the Crescendo website. We are looking for a motivated student to join our ongoing research on shallow-water vents, combining cultivation approaches with field survey, metagenomic approaches and geochemical measurements. Shallow-water vents are unique environments that have been less studies if compared to their deep-sea counterparts. In Italy, and especially in Naples where our lab is located, we have a number of shallow-water that we use as natural laboratories to study the interaction between microbial communities and their environments, trying to understand their contribution to biogeochemistry. The PhD project in question includes a period abroad visiting my colleague Prof. [Mustafa Yucel](https://ims.metu.edu.tr/people/yucel-mustafa-associate-prof-dr) at the Middle Eastern Technical University in Turkey, and an internship with the biotechnological company [Novamont](https://www.novamont.com/eng/), to work on new enzymes isolated from shallow-vents extremophiles. Given this is a MSCA funded position, applicants must not have lived or carried out their main activity (e.g. study, work, research) in Italy for more than 12 months in the past 3 years immediately prior to the Call deadline.

**PhD positions in my group at the University of Naples**. In addition to the MSCA PhD position described above, the call for new positions in the Doctoral Schools in Biology and Biotechnology at the University of Naples Federico II will open soon. One or more position might be available to join my lab depending on the score and interests of selected candidates. I will post the new call as soon as it become available, but for now you can check out the past call to get a sense of the requirement to apply. Here last year call in [Italian](http://www.unina.it/documents/11958/24993304/DOT-37_borse-INPS_2021-10-27_bando.pdf) and in [English](http://www.unina.it/documents/11958/25516556/PhD_37_CALL.pdf). The call should be out before the end of May and the deadline is usually less then a month after the call is announced. get in touch with me asap if interested!

##Postdoctoral Fellow positions
**ERC funded Postdoctoral Fellow positions to work on the physiological effects of trace element availability**. As part of our recent ERC funded Starting Grant [CoEvolve](www.coevolve.eu), we are looking for a microbiologist with experience in the culturing and physiology of microorganisms to join our lab to study the metabolic effects of trace element availability. The project is very exciting and we have a number of very cool experiment that we can discuss together, combining growth experiments of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms with molecular (qRT-PCR, proteomics) and computational tools and geochemical measurements. If you like the challenge of growing fastidious microbes in the lab, and you fancy the idea to use the results to explain the coevolution of Life with our Planet get in touch asap!

**PRIN funded Postdoctoral Fellow positions to work on the environmental distribution of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes using metagenomic approaches**. We have a new project starting on the environmental distribution of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes and the role of horizontal gene transfer in collaboration with [Ester Eckert](http://www.vb.irsa.cnr.it/people/researcher/eckert) at the CNR-IRSA of Verbania and [Elena Crotti](https://expertise.unimi.it/get/person/elena-crotti) at the University of Milano La Statale. We are looking for a microbiologist with previous experience in analyzing metagenomic data, possibly using genome-resolved metagenomic approaches and willing to work in a highly interdisciplinary group combining sequencing data with environmental data and

**Bioinformatic Postdoctoral Fellow positions**. We are looking for a postdoctoral fellow with a strong interest in the microbiology of extreme environments and a background in bioinformatic or computer science to join our group. Experience working and programming with R and python is required. Experience with MySQL databases, PhP and georeferenced data is a plus. If you are looking to combine your informatics experience with exciting global data coming from diverse extreme environments we have a number of very exciting project integrating fieldwork, wetbench, sequences and computational simulations that would benefit from you skills! Get in touch if interested! This is a postdoctoral level position (a PhD is required), but we might change it to a graduate fellowship if you lack a PhD but you have a Master Degree and the right background.
