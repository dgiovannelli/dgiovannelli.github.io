Shallow-water hydrothermal vents

Shallow-water hydrothermal vents are widespread ecosystems that have been previously understudied compared to their deep-sea counterparts (Giovannelli et al., 2013), despite the fact that these systems were known long before the discovery of the deep-sea vents on the Galapagos Rift in 1977. Because of their proximity to the surface, shallow-water hydrothermal systems are influenced both by geothermally generated reducing power and by light, and can be described as “high energy” environments, where chemolithoautrotrophy and photoautotrophy co-occur.

In the past few years I’ve been working on several shallow-water hydrothermal vent site worldwide (check out the field site map) to investigate the complex interactions between the microbial communities, geochemistry and geodynamics of these complex ecosystems. Despite a recent surge of interest from the scientific community, a lot remain to be done (see Price and Giovannelli, 2017 for an up-to-date review on this subject).
