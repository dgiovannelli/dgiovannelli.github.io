# Microbial-Enabled Terraforming project

The MM&H program is inviting proposals for the Microbial-Enabled Terraforming project. The detailed description of request for application can be found in the RFA below. Deadline for submission is Friday 6th December 2025 at 05.59 pm UTC. Proposal have to be submitted exclusively through the provided online submission system.

**NOTICE** _The deadline has been postponed to Sunday 8th December 2025 at 05.59 pm UTC_

## Request for Applications (RFA)

### Art. 1 - General
The MM&H program is designed to provide innovative solutions for the support of a long term human colonization of the cosmos. MM&H is requesting proposal for a microbial-enabled terraforming program. The primary objective of this RFA is to encourage the development of cutting-edge microbial-based technologies that might result in a long-term terraforming mission. These systems should address key aspects of the terraforming process, such as timeline and required effort, and aim for microbial colonization of the planet/target. Human colonization, while the ultimate goal of terraforming programs, is beyond the scope of thei RFA.

### Art. 2 - Proponents
Proposals can be presented by any of the class participant organized in team. Each team will need to be of minimum 2 and maximum 3 participants.

### Art. 3 - Terraforming target
The project should focus specifically on Mars. No other planetary body will be accepted.

### Art. 4 - Proposal format
The proposal can be a maximum of 5 pages (Arial, pt. 11, single line space, 2 cm margin on all side), including references, figures and tables, and will need to contain, at minimum, the following:

 1. State of the Art. Proposals should provide a comprehensive review of the current state of microbial research in space environments and microbial-enabled technologies for terraforming Mars.

 2. Prinicples and approaches. Applicants must outline the design and principles of the microbial-enabled terraforming program. The integration of microbial solutions should be clearly articulated.

 3. Timeline Plan. Proposals should include a detailed expected timeline that outlines the key steps of the terraforming plan, and a risk management strategy. This section should demonstrate the feasibility of the project.

 
### Art. 5 - Microbial-Enabled Support System
One of the key requirements of this RFA is the development of a microbial-enabled terraforming plan. Microbes play a critical role in Earth habitability, and the proposals should clearly demonstrate how microbial solutions will be integrated.

### Art. 6 - Project submission
Deadline for submission is Friday 6th December 2024 at 05.59 pm  UTC. Proposal have to be submitted exclusively through the provided online submission system [https://forms.gle/gjvRhymEnbjPfCyj9](https://forms.gle/gjvRhymEnbjPfCyj9). A single PDF should be uploaded, consisting of the proposal, the timeline table (single page) and the [Cover sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OT9Ae_VluF1IEYx3gc76bAZQyZixiIOZ-8ckxyDN5E/edit?usp=sharing). Template for the cover sheet can be found here. The proposal cover page will need to clearly indicate the project team and have their hand signatures present. Only proposal completed in all their part will be evaluated.

### Art. 7 - Evaluation Criteria
Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
 1. Scientific and technical merit (max 10 point)
 2. Innovation and novelty of microbial-enabled solutions (max 30 point)
 3. Feasibility and adherence to the RFA (max 30 point)
 5. Overall strategy (max 30 point)

Principal Investigators are requested to present and defend their project on Tuesday 10th, 2025 at 9 am by presenting 5 slides maximum in 5 minutes. This presentation will be followed by a 10 minute Q&A session. All submissions will undergo a rigorous review process by a panel of experts form the MM&H class.
